and the need for systemic change. The largest contributor to global CO₂ emissions is the energy sector, accounting for around 73% of emissions. This is driven by the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation. Within energy, electricity and heat production contribute the most, followed by transport.\n","\n","The transportation sector alone contributes about 16% of global CO₂ emissions, with road transportation being the most significant source due to the extensive use of gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles. This is followed by emissions from aviation and shipping, which are rapidly increasing, especially with the global growth in goods movement and international travel.\n","\n","The industrial sector contributes roughly 19% of global CO₂ emissions, with cement, steel, and chemical production being the major offenders. These industries are energy-intensive and often rely on fossil fuels for production processes.\n","\n","Agriculture, forestry, and land use account for approximately 18% of emissions, primarily through deforestation, methane emissions from livestock, and rice paddies.\n","\n","To reduce global CO₂ emissions, transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and adopting sustainable agricultural practices are critical. Additionally, shifting towards electric vehicles and promoting low-carbon industrial processes can significantly mitigate emissions."],"metadata":{"id":"WqAVo-YWEt8n"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"e_cvedWkLYYA"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
